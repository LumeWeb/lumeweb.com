          The advent of Bitcoin sparked innovation, but over time,
          centralization increased. Factors such as the influx of big money,
          greed, hype, and FOMO contributed to this trend. The introduction of
          many money legos worsened the situation, leading to boom and bust
          cycles.

          Web3 emerged as a buzzword to replace DeFi, but its meaning varies.
          Despite aiming for decentralization, Web3 relies on centralized
          crypto/DeFi infrastructure. Money dominates over ideology, driven by
          funders. A balance is necessary between free markets and public goods
          to address the current imbalance.

    <p class="font-body text-body text-xl">
      Web1 is probably best remembered by geeks as chat rooms and IRC (which
      still exist to this day, but only to power users). To normal users it was
      the age of AOL dial-up and similar networks where you got web, email,
      shopping, and chat all in one place..

    <h3 class="font-display text-3xl">Web2</h3>
    <p class="font-body text-body text-xl">
      Web2 since evolved with the web browser and we got better gaming, online
      apps, video streaming and calling and much, much more. However, it also
      got quickly captured by Silicon Valley and what some refer to as the "tech
      bros".
    </p>
    <p class="font-body text-body text-xl">
      So <i>despite</i> the innovation that occurred, it has turned into a top-down
      system where only a few geeks/CEO's and their investors control your entire
      web.
    </p>
    <p class="font-body text-body text-xl">
      This also excludes the wider internet infrastructure of domains and ISP's
      (internet providers and hosting), who also play a part in controlling your
      web, be it for your "safety", or other reasons.

    <p class="font-body text-body text-xl">
      We get the birth of Bitcoin and all of the innovation that followed. While
      BTC and a handful of other chains have remained decentralized both in
      operation, and access, the innovation over time has caused things to
      re-centralize.
    </p>
    <p class="font-body text-body text-xl">
      This is due to several factors including big money coming in, pushing
      greed, hype, and "FOMO". The invention of several new logos's causing this
      to only get worse, creating a classic "boom" and "bust". Human nature
      tends to be greedy, so over time, money overrode principles.
    </p>
    <p class="font-body text-body text-xl">
      Many development teams prioritized inventing new ideas and "shipping" them
      to users, while selling them "tokens" to exit at their expense, all while
      knowing none of what they created was <i>truly decentralized</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="font-body text-body text-xl">
      It became one large crypto casino.

    <h3 class="font-display text-3xl">Web3</h3>
    <p class="font-body text-xl text-body">
      What to say about Web3? Honestly... upfront it appeared to get used as a
      new buzz word to replace "DeFi". Terms like "Web3" and "Metaverse" have
      many different meanings to many people. It is intended to include more
      than just money and trading, and yet every blockchain-based system that
      can be labeled "web3" still builds onto of the same centralized
      crypto/defi infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p class="font-body text-xl text-body">
      The end result is an ecosystem that promotes and <b><i>wants</i></b> to be
      decentralized, but where money overrules ideology, ethos, and principles. This
      is in part due to who's bankrolling it all, and thus the incentives to build
      make it more about the money then about freedom.
    </p>
    <p class="font-body text-xl text-body">
      There needs to be a balance here between free markets/money and public
      goods/infra, and so far things are way out of wack and need to be fixed.
