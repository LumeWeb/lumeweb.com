    Some of the world's largest online threats right now are censorship of
    speech <i>and</i> money. Web3 represents unifying many legos to create a truly
    user-owned web. Decentralization is a means to an end, not the end itself. The
    true goal is that you are in control of your personal web, and no one else.
