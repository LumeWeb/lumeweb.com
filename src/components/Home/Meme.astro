          Time to Walk the Talk
      </h3>
      <p class="font-body text-xl md:text-3xl text-body">

          Let's have a heart-to-heart about Web3. There's a myth that needs to be cleared up. Some folks claim it's all about being wide open, but the reality is a bit more nuanced.
      </p>
        <p class="font-body text-xl md:text-3xl text-body">
           Not every Web3 service walks the talk. Censorship can actually find its way into blockchains too. It's a surprising twist, but it's something we need to fix.</p>
      <p class="font-body text-xl md:text-3xl text-body">
          But hold up – we're not here to point fingers. We're here to set things straight. It's about acknowledging the facts and rolling up our sleeves. Together, we're pushing for actual openness and the kind of decentralization that counts. It's not about fancy words; it's about action.
      </p>
        <p class="font-body text-xl md:text-3xl text-body">
            So, let's dive in and make Web3 what it's meant to be – no myths, just reality. Join us – it's time to turn talk into a true, open web for all.
